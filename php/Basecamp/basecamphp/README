INTRODUCTION

The Basecamp API is an XML REST interface for interacting with 
37 signals Basecamp Project management software.
The PHP wrapper is an implementation of the API as a PHP 4 class.

API documentation:
http://www.basecamphq.com/api

REQUIREMENTS

basecamp.php requires a couple of classes from PEAR. Specifically

HTTP_Request
XML_Serializer

which can be found (with documentation) at http://pear.php.net
These are really easy to install (if you have access to a command line)

	$ sudo pear install HTTP_Request
	$ sudo pear install XML_Serializer-0.18.0

The version number is necessary for XML_Serializer because its not yet a stable release.
If you get any messages while trying to install like 'Dependencies failed', just do

	$ sudo pear upgrade _Missing_Package_

!!! VERY IMPORTANT !!!
In order for this to work you need to enable API access on your Basecamp account.
The owner of the account has to do this in Basecamp > Settings.

USAGE

Its real easy to get stuff and send stuff to your Basecamp account.
First, initialize a Basecamp object with your credentials:

	$session = new Basecamp('myusername','mypassword','http://mybasecamp.baseurl.com');

Then its just a matter of calling the api function on the session. 
(see the internal documentation for more info).

	// Get all your projects

	// initialize 
	$session = new Basecamp('myusername','mypassword','http://mybasecamp.baseurl.com');
	// get the projects
	$projects = $session->projects();

	// get all the lists from your project
	$lists = $session->lists($projects[0]->id);

Because everything returned is an object (or an array of objects) its easy to arrange projects:

	$my_project = $projects[0];
	$my_project->messages = $session->message_archive($my_project->id);

You should reference the API docs (http://www.basecamphq.com/api) for all the details of the 
different Basecamp object types. Or you can always use the magical print_r function:
	
	print_r($projects);
