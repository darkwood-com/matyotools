<p class="summary">The <code>accesskey</code> attribute,
aimed at making web pages more accessible e.g. to people with
motoric disabilities, has proved out to be poorly designed and poorly
implemented. Although it is still endorsed by some recommendations,
it tends to reduce accessibility rather than help people, though
there are some special situations where it might improve useability.</p>
<p>The original version of this document had a much more
positive attitude to the <code>accesskey</code> attribute.
Experience and analysis has shown, however, that the idea of
author-defined shortcuts is generally not useful on the Web.
Moreover, serious damage is often caused by the way in which
the attribute has been implemented in browsers: it uses key combinations
that override built-in functionality in browsers and other software.
I have preserved the technical descriptions, however, since
they might be of some use.</p>
<P>
In <A TITLE="Getting Started with HTML; a primer by J. Korpela"
HREF="../html-primer.html">HTML</A>,
one can use the
<code>accesskey</code> attribute in
<a href="index.html"
title=
"Annotated links to tutorials, references, and specialized documents about HTML forms" 
>forms</a>
and
<a href="../HTML3.2/4.7.html"
title=
"Discussion of links in an HTML 3.2 tutorial"
>links</a>.
When supported by a browser,
it allows the user to use keyboard keys for
functions which are normally done using a mouse.
For example, to follow a link, one might (in some environments)
use the Alt key and a letter, as alternative to clicking on the link.
This requires that the author has specified an access key assignment
for that link, using the <code>accesskey</code> attribute.
Unfortunately, browser
support to the attribute is limited, and rather primitive.
The <code>accesskey</code> attribute tends to mask out the
functionality of a browser's predefined keyboard control,
which is often much more important than page-specific access keys.
Moreover, browsers do not indicate that access keys are available.
Authors may wish to consider including explicit notes about
access key assignments in their documents; this document suggests
some conventions about this. It also presents reasons for using
only <em>digit</em> keys as access keys.</P>

<h2><a name="why">Why access keys?</a></h2>
<P>
In the W3C note
<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/"
>Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</a></cite>,
section
<cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/#keyboard"
>Keyboard access</a></cite>, the need for
access keys is motivated as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><p>
Not every user has a graphic environment with a mouse or other pointing device. Some users rely on keyboard, alternative keyboard or voice input to navigate links, activate form controls, etc. Content developers should always ensure that users may interact with a page with devices other than a pointing device. A page designed for keyboard access (in addition to mouse access) will generally be accessible to users with other input devices. What's more, designing a page for keyboard access will usually improve its overall design as well.
</p></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>	    This can be crucial to people with
	    motoric disabilities.
Of course there are other
conditions where it could be necessary or useful.
To take a trivial example, if your mouse is temporarily broken,
you might still wish to do some Web surfing.
And in technologies which differ from "normal" PCs or terminals,
such as WebTV, laptops, and handheld devices,
a pointing device or function&nbsp;- if available at all&nbsp;- can
be significantly more difficult to use for exact pointing than
a good mouse.
</P>
<p>
Browsers generally support "tabbing" from one field to another in a form.
Thus, a form could usually be filled out without using a mouse or other
pointing device.
No special effort (like writing extra attributes)
is required from the author, except that 
he should put form fields into a logical order;
but that should be done anyway, so it's no <em>extra</em> effort.
Note that <dfn>order</dfn> here refers to the order in which the
form field elements appear in the HTML source.
If this does not coincide with the order in which they appear on <em>screen</em>,
problems may arise; this is one reason why one should not use
tables e.g. for formatting a table that way
but only for <a href="tables.html"
title="How to use tables to structurize forms in HTML"
>expressing the structure of a form</a>.
The problems caused by unnatural ordering of form fields could, in principle,
be reduced by using the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#adef-tabindex"
><code>tabindex</code> attribute</a>, but that too has limited
browser support.
</p>
<p>
For a <strong>large form</strong> with lots of optional fields,
so that the user would have to "tab" through quite a many fields
when he is ready to submit the form,
an author could make things easier.
He could
include an
<strong>accesskey</strong> attribute for the submit field.
That way, a user could use the access key to get into that field and
press enter or return key to submit the form.
</p>

<P>In this example, we assign an access key to a link defined by the

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>

<P>The invocation of access keys depends on the underlying system.
For instance, on machines running MS Windows, one generally has to
press the "alt" key in addition to the access key. On Apple systems,
one generally has to press the "cmd" key in addition to the access
key.

<P>The rendering of access keys depends on the user agent. We recommend
that authors include the access key in label text or wherever the access

such a way as to emphasize its role and to distinguish it from other
characters (e.g., by underlining it).

It seems to be the intent that the author specifies a label
(using the <code>LABEL</code> element) and that the browser

at present. See <a href="#display"

<h2><a name="support">Browser support</a></h2>

<p>Browser support
to the <code>accesskey</code> attribute is getting wider, but it's
still not universal; e.g., Netscape&nbsp;4 lacks it.
Since the whole idea is to provide <em>additional possibilities</em>
to users, this is not so serious as it may sound. As an author,
you can start using the attribute, and those users who really need
those possibilities will hopefully be able to select a browser
which supports them.</p>

<p>As some support has been added, the <strong>quality</strong>
of implementations has become an issue. The following discussion
will show that the implementations are still rather immature.
Naturally, the situation keeps changing, and some of the notes below
might be somewhat outdated. See also some interesting notes on
implementations in section
<cite><a href="http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/html/tagpages/attributes/accessibility.htm">Accessibility Attributes</a></cite>
of
<cite>Index DOT Html</cite>.</p>

<p><small>Generally, as regards to support to the features introduced
in the HTML&nbsp;4.0 specification, see the document
<a href="http://www.webreference.com/dev/html4nsie/"
       ><cite>HTML 4.0 in Netscape and Explorer</cite></a> 
(and
       <a href="../www/4.html">my margin notes</a> to it). There has
of course been progress after versions 4.0 of those browsers, but
the steps are far smaller than you would expect if you took the
version number game seriously.</small></P>

<p><strong>Internet Explorer on Windows</strong> has to some extent
supported <code>accesskey</code> since
version&nbsp;4.0. On IE&nbsp;4.0, if the value of that attribute is
a letter of the English alphabet,
then using the corresponding keyboard
key together with the Alt key will focus on the element where the
attribute appears. On newer versions, the support is wider; e.g.,
IE&nbsp;5.5 supports digits as access keys, too. For details, see
Microsoft's documentation of
<a href=
"http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/properties/accesskey.asp"
><code>accesskey</code> on IE</a>. Microsoft calls it
"accelerator key" in prose, since similar functionality 
in Windows user interface (e.g., in command menus)
was already called that way. The name reflects the idea of
speeding things up, rather than accessibility.
It is often faster to
use keyboard keys rather than the mouse.</p>

<p>Note that on IE, using the access key typically
<em>only</em> gives focus to the element. If the
element is a link, it is not followed. The user can thus move
to a link (e.g., in order to proceed by tabbing then), as separately
from following it, which can be activating by hitting the Enter key when
the focus is on the link. I think this is how things should be,
although there's the counterargument that <em>mostly</em> people just
want to follow links when they use access keys for links.
But the IE implementation
 might be seen as differing from what the specification suggests,
especially if you consider the example there that says
"In this example, we assign an access key to a link defined by the
<code>A</code>&nbsp;element.
Typing this access key takes the user to another document, in this case, a table of contents."
<p>The implementation of accesskeys on IE is not very consistent. For example,
using an accesskey for a checkbox does not just focus on it but
also toggles its setting. 
I can imagine the logic behind this, since for a link, there are
several things you could do with it (e.g., open in a new window
or view link properties), whereas for a checkbox, you normally
just want to toggle it.
<p>
There are many other
problems as regards to what using an access key really causes. For
example, if a submit button has an <code>accesskey</code> attribute,
should we assume that using the access key <em>submits</em>
 the form, instead of
just <em>focusing</em> on submit button? It would be rather natural to interpret
that it should indeed, if we consider what the specification says:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#adef-accesskey">
<p><span class="index-inst" title="focus::and access key"><a name=
"idx-focus-2">Pressing an access key assigned to an element gives focus to the
element.</a></span> The action that occurs when an element receives focus
depends on the element. For example, when a user activates a link defined by
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/links.html#edef-A" class="noxref"><samp class="einst">
A</samp></a> element, the user agent generally follows the link. When a user
activates a radio button, the user agent changes the value of the radio button.
When the user activates a text field, it allows input, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to say implicitly that "giving focus" automagically causes some
"activation", intentionally leaving it more or less open what "activation"
means in each case.
The specification should be clarified quite a lot as regards to the
semantics. But I'm afraid there's little hope; the work is oriented towards
<a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/"
title="XForms - The Next Generation of Web Forms"
>XForms</a> and other XML based approaches that break continuity
with HTML.</p>

<p>Testing on Netscape 6.1, Opera 6.0, and IE 5.5, all on Windows 98, 
I noticed confusing differences as regards to an access key for a submit
button:</p>
<ul>
<li> Opera doesn't support access keys
<li> IE focuses on a link when an access key is used but does not follow the
link (hitting "Enter" is needed), and it submits a form if an access key for
the submit button is used
<li> Netscape follows a link when an access key is used.
</ul>

<p>In IE on the 
Mac platform, access key is performed with the
control key, in combination with the 
key specified in the
<code>accesskey</code> attribute.
For links,
the implementation follows the link rather than just setting
focus on it.</p>

<p>On <strong>Netscape 6</strong>, the support is similar.
Using an access key to select a link causes the link to be followed.
And it seems that access keys are not supported for form buttons.</p>

<p>On Netscape,
the focus must first be on the web page itself before the accesskey
will work. In other words, if you just bring up Netscape and go to a page
with accesskeys specified, the accesskeys will not work until you either tab
into the web page or click on it with your mouse.</p>

<h2><a name="mask">Effect on built-in shortcuts</a></h2>

<P CLASS="warning"><a name="warn">
The <code>accesskey</code> attribute implementation typically
uses the same technique (Alt key) as the browser's built-in
user interface. This means that access key assignments in a document
may mask out some basic functionality
which users might be familiar with or, less seriously, the built-in
assignments might mask out the page-specific assignments.</a>
</P>
<P>For example, if you specify <code>accesskey="f"</code> for
some link or field, an IE user will not be able to use
Alt-F in its <em>normal</em> meaning within IE
(opening the <U>F</U>ile menu).
Whether the gain compensates for the loss depends on the
document and on the user.
But the browser's own shortcut assignments could be very important
to users, especially to people with disabilities, so overriding them
could cause severe problems, especially when the user does not know about
the situation.
It would be rather distracting if you are accustomed to, say, using Alt-a to
Add a page to a bookmark list, and then one day you note that on some page,
it submitted a form that you hadn't quite filled out yet.
</P>
<p>For a survey of conflicts, see the document
<cite><a href="http://www.wats.ca/resources/accesskeysandkeystrokes/38"
>Accesskeys and Reserved Keystroke Combinations</a> at
<a href="http://www.wats.ca" title=
"WATS.ca - Web Accessibility Testing and Services"
>WATS.com</a></cite>.</p>
<p id="alt2">However, the user can hit first the Alt key, then a normal key
(say, the "a" key), to invoke IE's built-in shortcut assignment.
I wonder how many users know that.
Moreover, this really works so that hitting the Alt key separately
activates the menu bar. Pressing IE's built-in hot key for the
menu you want then opens that menu.
This means that the workaround helps in some situations only.</p>
  
<P>To make things worse, it is impossible to list the "standard"
Alt key assignments in browsers since the assignments depend on
the <em>language</em> of the user interface.
For example, in the Finnish version of IE, Alt-F is unassigned
but Alt-T (from Finnish <span lang="fi"><U>T</U>iedosto</span>
 'file') opens a file menu.</p>
<p>Moreover, access key assignments may clash with other
technologies as well. For example, if you use IE in combination with
<a href="http://www-3.ibm.com/able/hpr.html">IBM Home Page Reader</a>
and the document contains an element with <code>accesskey="l"</code>,
then Alt-L will not work as an access key for the element but as
Home Page Reader's command (for "links reading mode").
The keyboard key assignments are often affected
by settings at the operating system level, too. The problems are
illustrated in the detailed document
<cite><a href=
"http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/?url=/library/en-us/dnacc/html/ATG_KeyboardShortcuts.asp?frame=true"
>Guidelines for Keyboard User Interface Design</a></cite>. And it needs
to be remembered that the variation within Windows platforms is just
one part of the variation in the World Wide Web.</p>

<h2><a name="ex">Examples</a></h2>

<P>Assuming that you are using a browser which supports

<h2><a name="display">Displaying the access key assignments</a></h2>

<P>As mentioned <a href="#asg">above</a>, one cannot rely on
browsers displaying the access key assignments (at present or

To clarify the situation, consider
the following example given in the HTML 4.0 specification:

 User Name
 &lt;INPUT type="text" name="user" id="fuser"&gt;

<P>The specification seems to suggest that a browser should
automatically indicate to the user that "U" is an accesskey for
the input field, e.g. by underlining that character (presumably
as it appears within the <code>LABEL</code> element).
But although IE supports (from version 4.0 onwards)
<code>accesskey</code>,
there's no underlining in the presentation. In fact there is no
evidence of real support to <code>LABEL</code>.
It is also debatable
whether the specification really suggests what it
seems to be suggesting--that browsers should, in a case like this,
check the content of the <code>LABEL</code>
field and underline (any?) occurrence
of the accesskey character!
</P><P>
Thus it seems that the <strong>author</strong>
should take care of the underlining or other specific presentation,
e.g. writing the content of <code>LABEL</code> in this case as
<PRE>
 &lt;U&gt;U&lt;/U&gt;ser Name
</PRE>
<P>Such explicit presentational suggestions may become
unnecessary in the future if the browser support improves,
of course.
But for the time being, we need to consider how to present them.
</P>

<P CLASS="important">
To let users benefit from access keys,
you need to take care of displaying the access key assignments.
</P>
<p>
The method used in the <a href="#ex">examples</a> above--explicitly
telling the access key after an element, and additionally bolding
the access key letter when applicable--is
somewhat naivistic but it can reasonably be expected to carry the
message to those who need it. The main problem with it would probably
not be the naivity but the fact that a reference to access keys might
confuse people who do <em>not</em> need that information. They might
have difficulties in understanding whether "accesskey" is something
they need to know about. You might consider making that word a link
to a suitable document about access keys. (The present document of mine
can be used for the purpose, although it would probably be all too
detailed for that.)
<P>
If there is a large number of access key assignments on a page
or if you would otherwise like to express the assignments
concisely, you could use one or several of the following
alternatives:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=4>
<TR><TH>Sample <TH>Explanation of the method<BR></TR> 
<TR><TD><U>h</U>ome <TD>
Make the access key letter <U>underlined</U>, using the
       <code>U</code> element. This would correspond to widespread
       usage for analogous assignments in many widely used programs
       (e.g. Web browsers).<BR>
  <TR><TD>Home<BR><TD> Make the access key letter appear in UPPERCASE. This too
       would correspond to widespread practice
  <TR><TD><STRONG>h</STRONG>ome <TD>
Make the access key letter <strong>strongly emphasized</strong>,
       using the
       <code>STRONG</code> element, or <B>bolded</B>, using the
       <code>B</code> element. (In this context, there isn't much
       practical difference between these; but in principle, a
speech-based user agent can be expected to present <code>STRONG</code>
in some meaningful way whereas <code>B</code>
would be meaningless to it.)
       This would make it more prominent. You might even consider
       suggesting--via a stylesheet or via the deprecated <code>FONT</code>
       element--a presentation where the letter appears in some
       distinctive color (although this might easily interfere with
       link colors).<BR>
</TABLE>
<P>These are all based on the assumption that the access key letter
appears in the context e.g. in the link text or in the explanatory
text (or label) preceding an input field. Usually that can be arranged;
as an author, <em>you</em> formulate those texts and you select the access key
assignments.
</P>
<P>
It can hardly cause harm to use <em>all</em> of the methods mentioned
to make the message clearer. 
</P>
<P>For normal submit (or reset)
<strong>buttons</strong> in forms, underlining and bolding
are impossible, 
since the text in a button is specified using an attribute,
and attribute values cannot contain HTML markup. Thus, for
example, if you have
<PRE>
&lt;INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Add this" accesskey="A"&gt;
</PRE>
<P>then you cannot underline or bold the letter "A" in "Add this".
Theoretically,
you could use
<code>INPUT TYPE="IMAGE"</code>
and an image which contains the text "<U>A</U>dd this"
with A underlined (and/or bolded),
but in practice
<a href="imagebutton.html">image buttons cause more problems
than they might solve</a>.
Since the use of uppercase alone is not a very good signal--even
if you otherwise use all lowercase in submit button texts--it seems to
be necessary to include an explicit remark about the access key.
</P>

<P CLASS="summary">
For <em>links</em>
it seems best to present the access key letter underlined, bold face,
and in upper case.
For <em>buttons</em>, write the access key
letter in upper case and provide an explanatory
statement about the access key.
</P>
<P>This is illustrated with the following simple examples:
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=4>
<TR><TH>HTML markup <TH>Presentation on your current browser </TR>
<TR><TD>
<PRE>
&lt;A HREF="index.html" accesskey="C"
&gt;table of &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;C&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;ontent&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>
<TD>
<A HREF="index.html" accesskey="C"
>table of <STRONG><U>C</U></STRONG>ontent</A>
<TR><TD>
<PRE>
&lt;INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" NAME="action" VALUE="Add this"
accesskey="A"&gt; (accesskey:&amp;nbsp;A)
</PRE>
<TD>
<form
accept="text/plain"
method="POST" action="http://www.cs.tut.fi/cgi-bin/run/~jkorpela/echo.cgi">
<INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Add this" accesskey="A" name="action">
(accesskey:&nbsp;A)
</form>
</TABLE>

<h2><a name="assign">"Standard" access key assignments?</a></h2>
<P>
It might be desirable to have some common conventions on access
key assignments, e.g. so that some specific access key would
always take you upwards in a document hierarchy.
There seems be little hope of uniformity in this area.
Quite often the access keys <em>need</em> to be application-dependent;
for example, when you have a form with lots of input fields, you
might have to use all characters a - z for them.
Moreover, access key assignments in a document might interfere
with <em>browser "standards"</em>, if the browser implements
<code>accesskey</code> similarly to access keys in its own
built-in user interface (as <a href="#warn">several browsers do</a>).
<P>
But should you like to adopt some <em>site-wide</em> "standard",
here is one possibility:</p>
<TABLE BORDER="1">

</TABLE>

<P>That would still leave several letters unassigned, so they
could be used for form fields and for essential links which
are not covered in the general scheme.</P>
       
<p>The <a href="http://www.webaim.org/">WebAIM</a>
(Web Accessibility In Mind)

<p>In the United Kingdom, the
<cite><a href=

Guidelines for UK Government websites</a></cite> specify, in section
<cite><a href=
"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/e-government/resources/handbook/html/2-4.asp#2.4.4">
2.4.4 UK Government accesskeys standard</a></cite>,
recommends the following assignments:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3"
summary="First column: accesskey character. Second column: its meaning"
>
<tr><th>S</th><td> skip navigation</td></tr>
<tr><th>1</th><td> home page</td></tr>
<tr><th>2</th><td> what's new page</td></tr>
<tr><th>3</th><td> site map</td></tr>
<tr><th>4</th><td> search facility on the site</td></tr>
<tr><th>5</th><td> frequently asked questions (FAQ)</td></tr>
<tr><th>6</th><td> help page/facility</td></tr>
<tr><th>7</th><td> complaints procedure</td></tr>
<tr><th>8</th><td> terms and conditions (including privacy statement)</td></tr>
<tr><th>9</th><td> feedback page</td></tr>
<tr><th>0</th><td> information about of accesskeys</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In practice, UK government sites contain other accesskeys as well.
For example the <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk">CabinetOffice</a>
site also assigns C, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, X, Y, and Z.
In practice this guarantees that there are many conflicts
with built-in keyboard shortcuts in browsers and other software.</p>

<p>The UK recommendation adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this navigational system is made available, it is important to inform your website users, as soon as they enter. Otherwise, users who are least able to do so will be faced with a mouse-dependent navigational system that could have been bypassed. Each page could display a message, e.g. 
&#8216;UK government accesskeys system&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that all users will receive an announcement about
technicalities, breaking a fundamental design principle.
Moreover, the announcement is apparently meant to be prominent.
This means causing disturbing all users in order to
potentially help a few.</p>

<p><span lang="da">Jesper Tverskov</span> has made an interesting suggestion:
<cite><a href=
"http://www.klapmusen.dk/artikel.aspx?xml=20021031&amp;lg=en"
>Use
first letter as <small>accesskey</small></a></cite>. Systematically
using the first letter of a link text as the accesskey could
be a simple, easy to understand and easy to remember scheme.</p>

<h2><a name="concl">Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>The <em>need</em> for access keys (in some sense) is obvious. There are many
reasons why pages should be made useable using keyboard only, without
a mouse,
and in a convenient way. But the 
<code>accesskey</code> attributes don't seem to help in
solving the problem very well.
They might be useful, if a site-wide system of access keys makes
a site more easily navigable. 
If you use them, the assignments should
be described separately, not in <code>title</code>
attributes or relying on underlining
or other small hints. And I would recommend using just <em>digits</em>
for access
keys, with digit&nbsp;0 acting as access key to a document that describes the
other assignments.</p>
